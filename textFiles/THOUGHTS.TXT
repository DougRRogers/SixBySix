        Aces in first column -darn it   ALL WITH HAND POINTING 
                                            THINGS OUT
        Two aces covered by two kings - Aieee!

        Mmmmm, I don't know about that!
        I dunno about that...

        Groan!
        Did you do that on purpose?
        You've got to be kidding!
        Are you not interested in actually winning this game?
        Well that's certainly unique!
        What an odd strategy...
        This should be interesting!

        That will be very helpful!

    Did you know there are still several moves?
    Hold it!  Are you sure you want to do that!
    You could make a really good move right here...
    Did you notice that ______________
    If only this could come out.
    
    This could be a problem  (four hands pointing at all the 10s)
    Don't forget you can move a whole stack on a pile
    Where is that darn Ace?
        
Asessment of Game:
        Your chances look good
        This will be interesting
        This will be tough
        AIEEEE!
        (Believe it or not,) its not hopeless yet
        You'd be amazed how many times it all comes
          together on the last card
        
Gentle Hints
    -Now you can do some organizing!
    -You can still make use of that blank column
    -Don't be too hasty in getting cards up top,
        they can be useful to "store" cards
    -you'd better rescue that low card!
    -POISON!
    -its best not to jumble up suits
    -why not wait till you've dealt a card, you'll have more
       information then
    -you should rescue this Ace right away
